This project is a sandbox for playing with satellite imagery. In the `Utilities` folder there are tools to:
- Extract information from the image metadata
- Transform raw Landsat Imagery to top of atmosphere (TOA)
- Combine images into multiband stack
- Normailize and enhance images for viewing
- General statistical tools and utilities for modeling and displaying data

The IPython notebooks put these tools to use:
- Visualizing multi-band imagery, showing the effects of different imagery enhancement methods
- Using random forest and Landsat 8 imagery to predict land cover
